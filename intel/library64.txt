This file contains information on all macros and functions in the library64.asm file

Plan to implement:
    function - WriteFloat
    macro - WRITE_FLOAT
    function - stoi
    MACRO - STOI

All macros for use:
  EXIT - exit code (0 - 255)
  NL
  NEWLINES - number of new lines
  SPACE
  ZERO_BUFFER - buffer, buffer length
  WRITE_BUFFER - buffer
  WRITE_BUFFERLEN - buffer, buffer length
  WRITE_UINT - unsigned int


All functions for use:
  ZeroBuffer - given a buffer, fills all entries with 0s
      input - rax: buffer, rbx: buffer length

  WriteBuffer - writes the char* buffer to the console
      input - rsi: buffer

  WriteUInt - given an unsigned integer, prints that value to the console
      input - rax: unsigned integer

  OpenFile - opens a file with the given name
      input - rax: file name, rdi: 
      output - rax: file descriptor

  CloseFile - closes the file with the given file descriptor
      input - rax: file descriptor
